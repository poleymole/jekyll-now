Creating my identity map was fun but also made me think about how I display myself online. I felt fine about sharing my map with my class as we were asked to only put on it what we would be happy to put online. It felt OK to comment on others maps as they were all quite good although not all of them matched the criteria set out by our teacher. I think this process was better than just putting my hand up in class as the people wouldn't know who you are. Lots of people said that mine was good but some people clearly didn’t read my map as they said that I hadn’t included anything about my future, but I actually had included about my future. I found this quite surprising. This is quite different to posting online as everybody has a style of handwriting and you can be 'found out’ from your handwriting but on the internet you type rather than writing. In my opinion the identity map didn’t change my view of social media or what I share online. Neither did these six lessons. 

Overall I think I will definitely use media-but not necessarily social media-to accomplish my goals in the future.
