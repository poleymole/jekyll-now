Binary is a code that is based on 0s and 1s. It is also known as base 2. It works like this:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>number</td>
    <td>64</td>
    <td>32</td>
    <td>16</td>
    <td>8</td>
    <td>4</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>37</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>72</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</table>


So if you have thirty-seven you would have one 32, one 4 and one 1. 0100101!

If you have seventy-two you would have one 64 and one 8.1001000

The reason for this is that computers can either be on or off so 1=on and 0=off. In this way computers can store data very efficiently.

There is a thing called hex which is base 16.
