Media is many things,social media among them. The list includes: Adverts, newspapers, billboards, movies, news, video games and more. We are all affected by media, even though we don't know it.Our society is based on media and if we didn’t have it our world would be totally different. Media literacy is: to quote wikipedia 

'*Media literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and create media. Media literate youth and adults are better able to understand the complex messages we receive from television, radio, Internet, newspapers, magazines, books, billboards, video games, music, and all other forms of media.’*

Basically if you are media literate you can make media, view media and understand what media is actually trying to get you to do.

In today's lesson we tried a game of bingo where we discovered some of the class were liars and said they could access the web whenever they wanted to. 

For homework we had to find an advert and see what it was trying to get us to do (make us buy/use that product). and how it was doing this.
