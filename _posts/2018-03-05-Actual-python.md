This week we made a very very very primitive AI and had it answer some questions. After the lesson, I even made mine ask a question! 

Here is the code

*while True:*

*  feeling = input("Are you well today? yes/no")    *

*  if feeling.lower() == "yes":*

*    print("I'm happy to hear that")      *

*    break*

*  elif feeling.lower() == "no":*

*   print("I'm sorry to hear that")*

*   break*

*  else:*

*    print("I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Please say yes or no")*

*while True:*

*  color = input("Do you prefer black or white?")*

*  if color.lower() == "black":*

*    print("cool")*

*    break*

*  elif color.lower() == "white":*

*    print("I'm sorry to hear that")*

*    break*

*  else:*

*    print("I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Please say Black or White")*

*while True:*

*  satisfaction = input("Are you happy with this survey yes/no")*

*  if satisfaction.lower() == "yes":*

*    print("I'm happy to hear that")*

*    break*

*  elif satisfaction.lower() == "no":*

*    print("I'm sorry to hear that")*

*    break*

*  else:*

*    print("I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Please say yes or no")*

*while True:*

*  Happiness = input("Are you happy today? yes/no")*

*  if Happiness.lower() == "yes":*

*    print("I'm happy to hear that")*

*    break*

*  elif Happiness.lower() == "no":*

*    print("I'm sorry to hear that")*

*    break*

*  else:*

*    print("I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Please say yes or no")*

*while True:*

*  Pen = input("Do you have a pen on you? yes/no")*

*  if Pen.lower() == "yes":*

*    print("Good, then we will test you")*

*    break*

*  elif Pen.lower() == "no":*

*    print("Please fetch one")*

*  else:*

*    print ("I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Please say yes or no")*

*number = "16105837"    *

*print ("Question one:")*

*print ((""))*

*while True:*

*  print ("Please write down this number")*

*  print ("The number is as follows " + number)*

*  adder = input("got that?")*

*  if adder.lower() == "yes":*

*    print ("well done")*

*    break*

*  elif adder.lower() == "no":*

*    print ("hurry up")*

*  else:*

*    print("I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Please say yes or no")*

*input_number = input ("So what was the number?")*

*if input_number == number:*

*  print ("well done")*

*else:*

*  print ("Great job there #obvioussarcasmisobvious")  *
