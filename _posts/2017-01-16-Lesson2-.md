    <td>I tried many different things, mainly skim reading the handbook as I already have some experience. I know this will not always work but it appears that it works so far.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think my not wanting to be the leader made me learn slower and also my non-proficiency with the keyboard meant I typed slower.</td>
