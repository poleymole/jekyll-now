In today's lesson we talked about our homework (to interview our parents about what they did on social media) and how some of us were surprised by what their parent/s said/didnâ€™t say.

We also started an 'identity map' which is where you state what your hobbies are where you live e.t.c. But we also had to include our future goals regarding college studies and future career(s), the types of media we use, including any social media and the types of media we will use in the future to accomplish our goals. 

For homework we had to finish the 'identity map'
