Diary of my codecademy usage:

45 mins when the homework was set

45 mins on the 4th of June.

30 mins on the 6th of june.

In these sessions I covered the basics of pyg latin and discovered that I don't know what is wrong with my transportation section.

In the lesson today we broke down the basics of what a command actually is and what it actually means. There are also some things that you need to know/have before you can complete it e.g. if i asked you to find my friend you would not be able to complete it because you don't know who that friend is.
