Today we went back to python(with turtle) and I made a 3D T. You can see how much coding there is in just one letter. There is probably a cleverer way of doing it but this way seems to work even if it is slightly longer. Notice I defined a function instead of just putting it straight into the code. This is because if I end up doing more letters then I can just call the functions instead of writing out the code over and over again.

import turtle

def letter_T(Top, Top_Sides, Undersides, Sides, Bottom, Lines):
  turtle.forward(Top)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(Top_Sides)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(Undersides)
  turtle.left(90)
  turtle.forward(Sides)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(Bottom)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(Sides)
  turtle.left(90)
  turtle.forward(Undersides)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(Top_Sides)
  turtle.right(45)
  turtle.forward(Lines)
  turtle.right(45)
  turtle.forward(Top)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(Top_Sides)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(Undersides)
  turtle.left(90)
  turtle.forward(Sides)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(Bottom)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(Sides)
  turtle.left(90)
  turtle.forward(Undersides)
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(Top_Sides)
  turtle.end_fill() 
  turtle.right(90)
  turtle.forward(Top)
  turtle.right(135)
  turtle.forward(Lines)
  turtle.right(180)
  turtle.forward(Lines)
  turtle.right(135)
  turtle.forward(Top_Sides)
