Today we went back to python(with turtle) and I made a 3D T. You can see how much coding there is in just one letter. There is probably a cleverer way of doing it but this way seems to work even if it is slightly longer. Notice I defined a function instead of just putting it straight into the code. This is because if I end up doing more letters then I can just call the functions instead of writing out the code over and over again.
