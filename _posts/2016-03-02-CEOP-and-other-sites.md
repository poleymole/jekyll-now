Today we learnt about sites like CEOP and what they do. They help you to cope with 'harassment' online. We also watched some videos about a situation like that. You can try too by going to ‘*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqLFAYeYVb*Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqLFAYeYVbQ)’. CEOP has a website which is designed for kids called ‘https://www.thinkuknow.co.uk/’ you can go there to report online ‘harassment’ or get advice on how to avoid it. You should always tell your parents when you are being ‘harassed’ online
