Today to start off with we got into groups of three and decided out of a group of statements which ones were most dangerous and which ones were harmless. These statements ranged from posting a picture of your cat to telling everybody that you're on holiday (and that your house is empty).

Then we watched some videos about how social media is taking over our lives (in the video everyone was using their phone to record the moment rather than enjoying it) and how people are 'tweeting' every little thing from their lunch to their feet.

I think we probably need to stop being so addicted to technology/social media and actually enjoy what's happening around us.
