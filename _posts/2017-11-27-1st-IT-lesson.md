Today we made a 'virtual shop' where you can ‘buy’ items and the spreadsheet will work out how much it will cost.  A cool feature of it is that instead of needing to type it in every time, I have a drop-down box that lets me quickly select items without the possibility of having a typinh errot in the text. I succeeded in doing this although many of my peers didn’t manage this.
